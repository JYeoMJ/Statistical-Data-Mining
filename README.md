# Statistical-Data-Mining
Consolidation of coursework from Statistical Data Mining (ST5227 Applied Statistical Learning) module.

This module focuses on the most recent but well accepted methods, especially those in investigating big and complicated data, including Ridge/Lasso and Logistic regression, Spline-Smoothing, Semi-Parametric and Nonparametric Methods, Tree Based Methods, K-Nearest Neighbours and Unsupervised Learning Methods.

* Wk 1 - Introduction to Data Mining, Linear Methods for Regression
* Wk 2 - Regularized Regression Models (Ridge/Lasso/Elastic Net) & Logistic Regression
* Wk 3 - Spline Smoothing and Semi-Parametric Models (Segmented Linear, Polynomial Splines, Partially Linear Additive Models)
* Wk 4 - Varying Coefficient Regression Model, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
* Wk 5 - Local Averaging (Nonparametric) Methods (Kernel Smoothing Estimators, Bandwidth Selection, Projection Pursuit Regression)
* Wk 6 - Cross Validation
* Wk 7 - Tree Based Methods (CART, Bagging, Boosting, Random Forests)
* Wk 8 - kNN Regression and Classification
* Wk 9 - Unsupervised Learning (PCA, K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering)
* Wk 10 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

All works uploaded here reflect my own consolidated notes, tutorial works, and annotations.
